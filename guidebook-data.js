        content:
          'Class & effect: Central-acting analgesic and antipyretic with minimal anti-inflammatory activity. No effect on platelet function in recommended doses.\n' +
          'Indications: First-line for headache, musculoskeletal pain, dysmenorrhea, post-operative pain, fever. Preferable to NSAID in children and pregnancy.\n' +
          'Dosing guide: Typical adult dose 500–1000 mg PO every 6 hours (max 4 g/24 h). Adjust dose in low body weight or chronic liver disease. Document time and total daily intake.\n' +
          'Cautions: Monitor INR in patients on vitamin K antagonists; NAPQI metabolite may increase anticoagulant effect. Avoid chronic high-dose use—risk of medication-overuse headache and hepatotoxicity. Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.\n' +
          'Overdose management: Suspect toxicity if >150 mg/kg in 24 h or staggered supratherapeutic dosing. Initiate N-acetylcysteine per local protocol and follow LFT/INR trends.\n' +
          'Follow-up: Reassess analgesic effect; escalate to multimodal regimen if inadequate. Taper long-term daily use to prevent rebound headache.',

          'Class & effect: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (propionic acid derivative) providing analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory action via COX inhibition.\n' +
          'Indications: Short-term treatment of mild to moderate pain (e.g., dental, musculoskeletal, dysmenorrhea) and fever when anti-inflammatory effect is needed.\n' +
          'Dosing guide: Adults and adolescents ≥12 yrs: 200–400 mg PO every 6–8 hours with food; max 1200 mg/24 h OTC. Consider lowest effective dose for shortest duration. Maintain hydration.\n' +
          'Cautions: Avoid in active peptic ulcer, GI bleeding, severe heart failure, renal insufficiency, or known NSAID hypersensitivity. Use with caution in hypertension, dehydration, asthma, and third trimester pregnancy. Monitor for GI upset; co-prescribe gastroprotection in high-risk patients.\n' +
          'Drug interactions: Increased bleeding risk with anticoagulants/antiplatelets; reduced antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors/ARBs; additive nephrotoxicity with diuretics. Space dosing when combined with other NSAIDs.\n' +
          'Field notes: Encourage administration with food to reduce dyspepsia. Discontinue and seek medical review if melena, hematemesis, or persistent abdominal pain develops.',

          'Cautions: Reserve for opioid-tolerant adults; monitor for respiratory depression, sedation, and opioid-related adverse effects. Reduce initial dose in elderly or organ impairment; avoid MAO inhibitors and adjust in renal/hepatic dysfunction.\n' +
          'Handling: Place lozenge against cheek and rotate with applicator over 15 minutes; do not chew or swallow whole. Secure unused units per controlled substance policy.',
